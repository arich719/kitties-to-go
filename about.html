<h4> About Us</h4>
<p> Kitties to go started in 1980 when people owned cats and dressed really bad. Some of the first cat magazines were started during this period. Cat fancy was the first to feature a cat on the cover. Kitties to go followed afterwards and has been a mainstay in cat lovers hearts every since. Tribe behavior has been the reason for the amount of copies that has been sold since the 1980's. And it is the reason that it will not end anytime soon.</p>
<p> Soon to follow will be an alernative website about the things cats think about when people ask them questions. This will be made possible by Elon Musk and his telelink brain chip for animals. Testing has been sucessfully so far and will be ready for consumers as soon as the government approves it. This should get approval in the next two years. Until we will have to guess. But Kitties to go will still be around and will be reporting on the anti social behavior of kittiens.</p>
